          Since its founding in November 1970, the Central Florida Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society (Central Florida 
          Chapter) always had a dream of having a permanent home for Chapter activities and a railroad museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tavares & Gulf Railroad (T&G) built their second depot (a replacement for the first) in Winter Garden in 1913 at the 
          southeast corner of the intersection of South Boyd and Joiner Streets. The depot served the T&G and Winter Garden until 
          December 1969 when the line between Winter Garden and Astatula was abandoned; the Seaboard Coast Line RR (SCLRR) continued to 
          use the building as their depot from January 1970 until March 1978 when the depot was closed and the freight agent services 
          were transferred to a mobile agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Central Florida Chapter became aware of the SCLRR’s intention to close their Winter Garden depot several years before the 
          actual closing. On November 11, 1976, the Chapter voted to pursue acquisition of the former T&G depot when the SCLRR abandoned it 
          with the purpose of establishing a permanent home and a railroad museum. The Central Florida Chapter’s dream started to become a 
          reality when it purchased the former depot from the SCLRR on October 22, 1979. Restoration efforts on the structure began immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          On January 18, 1981, the Central Florida Railroad Museum opened on a limited basis in the depot’s two former waiting rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          On May 10, 1982, the Roper Brothers Foundation in Winter Garden donated to the Chapter its building immediately east of the 
          former depot.  The building was (and still is) attached to the depot through a covered breezeway that was used to unload farm 
          tractors and automobiles that were shipped to Winter Garden on the T&G.  This structure became known as the Roper Building.
        </p>
        <p>
          On May 21, 1983 the Chapter held the grand opening and dedication of the Central Florida Railroad Museum. Guest speakers included 
          Richard Sanborn (President and CEO of the Seaboard System RR), Jean Yothers (Director of the Orange County Historical Museum), 
          Winter Garden Mayor Ralph Fulford, Chapter President Richard Sharp, and Chapter Member Phil Cross. A privately owned and 
          operating 0-4-0T steam locomotive and a Seaboard System U-36-B Diesel Electric Locomotive and caboose were also displayed as 
          part of the dedication ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 1, 1983, the Chapter purchased the land immediately east of the Roper Building from the Seaboard System Railroad.  
          With this purchase, the Chapter now owned an entire block and their dream of owning and operating a railroad museum finally 
          became a reality.

          On November 15, 1985, the Chapter began the restoration of the Depot’s freight room into a meeting room for monthly Chapter 
          meetings. The first meeting was held in the Museum in January 1986. The restoration efforts were completed in May 1987.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September 1990, the Chapter acquired Seaboard System Railroad Caboose #11073 (Former Clinchfield Railroad Caboose #1073).  
          During August 1996, Chapter members completed the restoration of the caboose.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November 1992, the Museum’s Ernest S. Green Memorial Library  was moved to the room built in the east end of the Museum Meeting 
          Room from the small room in the main part of the depot.
        </p>
        <p>
          In December 1994, the Chapter completed installation of central heat and air conditioning system in the Museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September 1999, the Chapter became a Partner in Education with the Lakeville Elementary School in Apopka. In May 2000, the 
          school’s reception area and its large multi-purpose room became a railroad museum, an extension of the Central Florida RR Museum. 
          The multi-purpose room was lined with railroad photographs and display cases of railroad memorabilia from the Central Florida 
          Railroad Museum’s collection. The room also has a large working Lionel train layout. The reception area of the school was filled 
          with railroad memorabilia, model trains and flashing railroad crossing signals. April 2001 – Chapter member Henry Lebel is 
          guest speaker at the grand opening of the Lakeville Elementary School Railroad Museum.  Also in 2001, the Chapter helped the 
          school acquire a former Atlantic Coast Line M-5 caboose for display on the school grounds. Lakeville uses mottos “We’ve Been
          Working on the Railroad” and “Home of the Engineers”.
        </p>

          In April 2000, the family of the late Chapman S. Root donated a major part of Mr. Root’s railroad memorabilia collection to the 
          Central Florida Chapter for display in the Central Florida Railroad Museum. The donation included a large collection of railroad 
          dining car china and silver service, dining car menus, railroad signs, Pullman memorabilia, Railway Express memorabilia, table 
          linens and uniforms and custom made glass display cases for display of the items. Mr. Root’s Chesapeake & Ohio caboose is also on 
          display at the Winter Garden Heritage Museum which is located on Plant Street in downtown Winter Garden in the former Atlantic Coast 
          Line Railroad depot. Mr. Root owned Associated Coca-Cola, the largest Coca-Cola bottling company in the country. He also owned 4 
          private railcars which he used for family travel and vacations. Two of his railcars and his Coca-Cola collection are now on display 
          at the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Daytona Beach, Florida.

          On June 13, 2003, the museum was used as a movie set for segments of the movie “Iron Texas.”
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 3, 2003, the museum began being open 7 days per week from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Ginny Green was hired as the Museum’s first full-time host.

          Railroad Museum is operated under a cooperative agreement between the City of Winter Garden, the Winter Garden Heritage Foundation 
          and the Central Florida Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. The Winter Garden Heritage Foundation provides the funding

          During July 2005, Chapter Member Ward Britt arranged for Boy Scout Troop #210 to upgrade interior of Roper Building at no cost as an 
          Eagle Merit Badge Project for Scout Tim Keating. Work was supervised by a licensed contractor. Improvements included installation of 
          interior insulation, walls and ceilings, and air conditioning. Work was completed in late September.

          On February 17, 2007, Scott Edwards of Boy Scout Troop #86 at the LDS Church in Clermont began restoration of a small former office 
          in the Roper Building for his Eagle Badge project. The work was supervised by a licensed contractor. The restoration was completed on 
          June 16th. Several scouts and parents assisted Scott with his Eagle Badge project. A small air conditioner was installed to reduce 
          humidity and keep the room at a somewhat constant temperature. The Chapter stores their photograph collection and VHS tape collection 
          in the office. Computers are also located in the office to help manage the Chapter’s collection of railroad-related artifacts.
