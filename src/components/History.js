      <p>
        The Central Florida Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society, Inc. was 
        chartered on November 8, 1970, with fourteen founding members. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From its inception, the Chapter always had a dream of having a permanent home 
        for Chapter activities and a railroad museum. The Chapter purchased the former 
        Tavares & Gulf Railroad depot at Winter Garden from the Seaboard Coast Line 
        Railroad on October 22, 1979, and immediately began restoration efforts on the 
        structure. Today, the structure houses the Central Florida Railroad Museum.
      </p>

        On November 8, 2010, the Chapter celebrated its 40th Anniversary at its regular 
        monthly meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        On August 13, 2012, the Chapterâ€™s membership voted to withdraw from the 
        National Railway Historical Society, Inc. and form the Central Florida Railway 
        Historical Society, Inc.  The official date for the change was January 1, 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the operation of the Central Florida Railroad Museum, the Central 
        Florida Railway Historical Society, Inc. is committed to the collection and 
        preservation of railroad history, with a special focus on Central Florida, 
        and the restoration and exhibition of railroad memorabilia for the education 
        and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Central Florida Railroad 
        Museum is operated under a cooperative agreement between the City of Winter 
        Garden, the Winter Garden Heritage Foundation and the Central Florida Railway 
        Historical Society, Inc.    
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, the Society has been involved in a number of activities that 
        include sponsoring model train and railroadiana shows, setting up and manning 
        exhibits at the Central Florida and Lake County Fairs, hosting North American 
        Rail Car Operator Association motor car visits to Winter Garden and the Central 
        Florida Railroad Museum, hosting annual meetings of the Florida Chapter of the 
        Morse Telegraph Club, hosting Society field trips to railroad-related locations 
        throughout Florida and the southeastern United States, loaned railroad-related 
        artifacts for displays throughout Central Florida, and sponsored train rides out 
        of Winter Garden over the Florida Central Railroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Society holds monthly meetings at the Central Florida Railroad Museum 
        at 101 South Boyd Street on the second Monday of each month beginning at 7:00 
        P.M. After a short business meeting, a break is taken for refreshments and 
        socializing prior to the presentation of a railroad-related program. Through 
        monthly meetings and other Society-related activities, members come together 
        to share a deep interest in railroading. Members come from all walks of life; 
        most have no connections with railroads other than as a hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Society also holds monthly workdays at the Central Florida Railroad 
        Museum to maintain its railroad memorabilia collection, to take care of 
        minor repairs and housekeeping chores, and to fellowship with other members.
      </p>
