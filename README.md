## Project Summary

This is an individual capstone project built completely by [Rick Murdock](http://rickmurdock.com/) soon after graduating from The Iron Yard coding school in Nashville, Tennessee, with a Certificate in Front-End Engineering. This new updated website will replace the existing, outdated website for the Central Florida Railroad Historical Society, Inc. I was familiar with this organization and contacted one of the board members and offered to redesign and build a responsive modern site free of charge. 

This started out as a simple HTML and CSS site. About halfway through development, I stopped and decided to build this with React. This allowed me to reuse header and footer components and the site now functions as a Single Page App (SPA).

The following technology was used for this project:

* [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)

* [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) / [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html)

* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

* [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/)
